##  Pages Overview

Below is a detailed explanation of each page in our platform and the technologies or logic used in each:
We aim to show how every part of the project was built and how we applied the required features.

1- Homepage 

On the **homepage**, we showcased the **key features of our volunteering platform** in a clear and engaging layout.
We also integrated an **external API** to display the latest volunteering news, aiming to **encourage users to register and engage** by browsing relevant and inspiring content.

## ‚úÖ Project Rubric Mapping (13 Elements)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ HTML Structure
We used valid, semantic HTML5 elements inside React (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<form>`, `<footer>`) ensuring a logical document flow and good accessibility.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ CSS Styling
The project applies external CSS with a consistent color palette, gradients, rounded corners, and modern UI design, using both flexbox and grid for layout and responsive behavior.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Responsive Design
Media queries ensure the site adapts well to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes, maintaining a usable and visually appealing interface across devices.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ JavaScript Functionality
We implemented interactive features using JavaScript and React, such as form submission handling, conditional rendering, and dynamic updates based on user actions.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ React Components
The app is divided into reusable React components (like `Header`, `HeroSection`, `LoginForm`, `OpportunityCard`), each handling its own logic and UI, improving modularity and maintainability.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ State Management
We used React‚Äôs `useState` and props to manage component state, control user inputs, display dynamic content, and maintain a smooth user experience without unnecessary page reloads.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Routing (if applicable)
The project optionally uses React Router (or similar) to handle navigation between pages or sections, ensuring seamless transitions without full-page reloads.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ API Integration (if applicable)
Where needed, we integrated external APIs (via `fetch` or `axios`) to pull live data into the app ‚Äî such as volunteer opportunities or user details ‚Äî and render it dynamically.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Accessibility (A11y)
We ensured accessibility by using descriptive `alt` text, proper heading levels, sufficient color contrast, keyboard-friendly navigation, and semantic roles where appropriate.

### üîü Performance Optimization
We optimized asset sizes (images, CSS), followed best practices for component rendering, and structured the project to minimize unnecessary re-renders and improve load speed.

### 11Ô∏è‚É£ Code Quality & Best Practices
The project code is well-organized, with clear naming conventions, consistent formatting, reusable logic, and comments explaining key parts ‚Äî making it easy to maintain and expand.

### 12Ô∏è‚É£ Version Control (Git)
We used Git for tracking changes, maintaining a clear commit history, branching (if used), and pushing the project to a public or private repository for review.

### 13Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Hosting
The project is deployed using services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages, ensuring it‚Äôs publicly accessible and shareable, with a live link for demonstration and testing.
